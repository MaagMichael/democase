https://www.wisp.blog/blog/server-actions-vs-api-routes-in-nextjs-15-which-should-i-use

SAAS techniqies like:
- payments with stripe and web hooks
- prisma to connect to a database
- database SQL and No SQL (Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, sqLite, MySQL, MariaDB)
- authentication with Clerk, Firebase Auth, Auth0, or Auth.js
- emailing (emailJS, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun, or Amazon SES)
- data fetch with revalidatePath and caching

example of middleware e.g. auth with login and protected routes

webhooks (example payments by LemonSqueezy or Stripe )

search params and state in URL (usecase vintageclub over min. 2 levels)
